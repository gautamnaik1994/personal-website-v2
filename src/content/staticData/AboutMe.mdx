**Machine Learning Engineer & Data Scientist** with 9 years of software engineering experience, including **5 years** of dedicated, hands-on expertise in AI, ML, and Data Science. I leverage a strong foundation in Supervised, Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and MLOps to develop innovative AI solutions. Complementing this, I am proficient in cloud architecture (AWS Lambda, CDK, Docker) and robust backend development (Python, FastAPI, DynamoDB) to build and deploy scalable, production-ready AI/ML systems.

In my recent work, I developed a generative AI application that streamlined the recruitment process by evaluating and ranking candidate CVs based on their alignment with specific job descriptions, and built a Generative AI interview bot using LLM to rate candidate answers, significantly reducing the recruiting team's workload. Previously, I led the company's transition to data-driven decision-making through ML implementation, building a sales forecasting model that increased profit by 15% and a recommender system that boosted sales across product categories.

I am passionate about applying my combined expertise in ML and Data Science to drive impactful, scalable solutions and bridge the gap between software engineering and AI-driven innovation.
