Throughout my **9 years** as a Software Engineer, I've concurrently developed **5 years** of practical expertise in Data Science and Machine Learning. This continuous growth has resulted in a unique blend of software development proficiency and a strong foundation in data-driven strategies.

My tech stack includes strong backend proficiency with Python, Node.js, FastAPI, MySQL, and DynamoDB, alongside solid frontend skills in React.
Furthermore, I have experience in creating and deploying scalable serverless applications on AWS using AWS Lambda and AWS Cloud Development Kit.

My Machine Learning and Data Science expertise is built through practical personal projects in predictive modeling, data analysis, and ML application development.
I am currently enrolled in the Scaler <a href="https://www.scaler.com/data-science-course/" target="_blank">Data Science and Machine Learning Program<span className="icon-open-new-tab"></span></a> to deepen my expertise in ML algorithms, statistical modeling, and AI-driven solutions.

I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my expertise in ML and Data Science to drive impactful, scalable solutions
while bridging the gap between software engineering and AI-driven innovation. If you're looking for a versatile engineer with a strong
product mindset, a passion for machine learning, and a proven track record in delivering effective AI-driven solutions, let's connect!
