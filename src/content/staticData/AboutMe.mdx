With over **9 years** of experience as a Software Engineer complemented by **4 years** of hands-on learning and application in Data Science and Machine Learning,
I bring a unique blend of software development expertise and a strong foundation in data-driven decision-making.

I excel in frontend technologies such as ReactJS and have strong skills in backend development with Python, Node.js, FastAPI, MySQL, and DynamoDB.
Furthermore, I have experience in creating and deploying scalable serverless applications on AWS using AWS Lambda and AWS Cloud Development Kit.

My growing expertise in Machine Learning and Data Science includes working on personal projects in predictive modeling, data analysis, and ML-driven applications.
I am currently enrolled in the Scaler <a href="https://www.scaler.com/data-science-course/" target="_blank">Data Science and Machine Learning Program<span className="icon-open-new-tab"></span></a> to deepen my expertise in ML algorithms, statistical modeling, and AI-driven solutions.

I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my expertise in ML and Data Science to drive impactful, scalable solutions
while bridging the gap between software engineering and AI-driven innovation. If you're looking for a versatile engineer with a strong
product mindset, a passion for machine learning, and a proven track record in delivering effective AI-driven solutions, let's connect!
