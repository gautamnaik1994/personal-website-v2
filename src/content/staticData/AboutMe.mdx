**Machine Learning Engineer** with **6 years** of dedicated **AI/ML and Data Science** expertise, backed by **9 years** of overall **software engineering experience**. I leverage a strong foundation in Supervised, Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and MLOps to develop innovative AI solutions. Complementing this, I am proficient in cloud architecture (AWS Lambda, CDK, Docker) and robust backend development (Python, FastAPI, DynamoDB) to build and deploy scalable, production-ready AI/ML systems.

My key achievements include **boosting** e-commerce **profits by 15%** through AI/ML systems for sales forecasting and inventory optimization, alongside **reducing bounce rate by 70%** with deep learning text summarization. I have also significantly impacted operations by **accelerating** recruitment by **60%** and **reducing** recruiter workload by **50%** using cutting-edge Generative AI applications (Langchain, LLMs) for CV evaluation and interview automation, all while ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness through proficiency in serverless microservices on AWS (CDK, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway).

I am passionate about applying my combined expertise in ML and Data Science to drive impactful, scalable solutions and bridge the gap between software engineering and AI-driven innovation.
