Throughout my **9 years** as a Software Engineer, I've cultivated **5 years** of hands-on expertise in Data Science and Machine Learning, creating a powerful synergy of software development proficiency and data-driven strategies. My background includes robust backend development skills with Python, Node.js, FastAPI, MySQL, and DynamoDB, complemented by strong frontend capabilities in React. I have experience in designing and deploying scalable serverless applications on AWS, utilizing AWS Lambda and AWS Cloud Development Kit.

In my recent work, I developed a generative AI application that streamlined the recruitment process by evaluating and ranking candidate CVs based on their alignment with specific job descriptions and built a Generative AI interview conducting bot using LLM for rating candidate answers that lessened the workload of the recruiting team.  Previously, I led my team to transition to data-driven decision-making through ML implementation, building a sales forecasting model that increased profit by 15% and a recommender system that increased sales across product categories.

I am passionate about applying my combined expertise in ML and Data Science to drive impactful, scalable solutions and bridge the gap between software engineering and AI-driven innovation.
